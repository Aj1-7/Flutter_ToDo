This project involved the creation of a To-Do app using Flutter. The app was designed to provide a user-friendly platform for managing tasks efficiently. Core functionalities included adding, editing, and deleting tasks. A checkbox system allowed users to mark tasks as complete.

Flutter's reactive framework was leveraged to ensure real-time updates of the task list. The app prioritizes a clean and intuitive interface to enhance user experience. Future enhancements may include task prioritization, reminders, and integration with cloud storage for synchronization.
